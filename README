 Linux Device Driver for interfacing accelerometer using Raspberry Pi

In order to use code following steps are to be performed - 
- first of all make sure that i2c drivers are installed in your system.

Now steps to execute -
1. Get whole project into a folder and point your directory path towards it.
2. run >> make all
3 Insert the module using >> sudo insmod adxl.ko
4 To check whether i2c device (here accelerometer)  is been detected or not run
 >> sudo i2cdetect -y 1 // This wil point out the address of the i2c device (0x53 in case of accelerometer ) if it is detected.
4. Finally, for demo of driver run the python script using
                                                                                           >> sudo python script.py
Result â€“ Tilting of the accelerometer will give varying reading of x- , y- . and z- axis .
